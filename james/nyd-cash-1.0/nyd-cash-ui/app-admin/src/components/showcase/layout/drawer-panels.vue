        The Drawer Panel (also known as a Sidebar) is the element on the left
        side (or right side) of your screen, usually used for Navigation, which gets
        hidden on smaller screens and is shown alongside the Page content on wide
        enough screens. Breakpoints are configurable in JS.
      </p>
      <p>
        Drawer Panels can use a QScrollArea for enhancing design and behavior of
        scrollbar. Furthermore, due to some Layout features, they can scroll along
        the content should you wish to. Play with the Layout to see this in effect.
      </p>
      <p>
        Drawers can be activated by swiping them into view from the edge of the screen
        or by clicking/tapping on menu buttons. Their position is based on how you
        structure the layout template. You can, for instance, display a Drawer on right
        side of screen on big screens but swipe them from left on smaller screens.
        It's up to you and where you place the Drawer HTML tag.
